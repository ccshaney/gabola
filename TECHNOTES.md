#### *Step I. Produce non-duplicate split fastqs sorted by barcodes from raw linked reads*

**Input:**

**Output:**

- Directories for every barcode containing their respective reads that are trimmed and filtered (OUTPUT_FOLDER/nonDupFq/split). 
> For example, Barcode name: AAAACCCCGTGTGTGT
> Format: OUTPUT_FOLDER/nonDupFq/split/AAAACCCCGTGTGTGT_1
